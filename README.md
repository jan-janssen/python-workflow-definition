# Python Workflow Definition
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pyiron-dev/python-workflow-definition/HEAD)

## Definition
In the Python Workflow Definition (PWD) each node represents a Python function, with the edges defining the connection 
between input and output of the different Python functions. 

## Format
Each workflow consists of three files, a Python module which defines the individual Pythons, a JSON file which defines
the connections between the different Python functions and a conda environment file to define the software dependencies.
The files are not intended to be human readable, but rather interact as a machine readable exchange format between the 
different workflow engines to enable interoperability. 

## Examples
### Simple Example 
As a first example we define two Python functions which add multiple inputs: 
```python
def add_x_and_y(x, y):
    z = x + y
    return x, y, z

def add_x_and_y_and_z(x, y, z):
    w = x + y + z
    return w
```
These two Python functions are combined in the following example workflow:
```python
x, y, z = add_x_and_y(x=1, y=2)
w = add_x_and_y_and_z(x=x, y=y, z=z)
```
For the workflow representation of these Python functions the Python functions are stored in the [simple_workflow.py](simple_workflow.py)
Python module. The connection of the Python functions are stored in the [workflow_simple.json](workflow_simple.json) 
JSON file:
```
{
  "nodes": {
    "0": "simple_workflow.add_x_and_y_and_z",
    "1": "simple_workflow.add_x_and_y",
    "2": "simple_workflow.add_x_and_y",
    "3": "simple_workflow.add_x_and_y",
    "4": 1,
    "5": 2
  },
  "edges": [
    {"target": 0, "targetHandle": "x", "source": 1, "sourceHandle": "x"},
    {"target": 1, "targetHandle": "x", "source": 4, "sourceHandle": null},
    {"target": 1, "targetHandle": "y", "source": 5, "sourceHandle": null},
    {"target": 0, "targetHandle": "y", "source": 2, "sourceHandle": "y"},
    {"target": 2, "targetHandle": "x", "source": 4, "sourceHandle": null},
    {"target": 2, "targetHandle": "y", "source": 5, "sourceHandle": null},
    {"target": 0, "targetHandle": "z", "source": 3, "sourceHandle": "z"},
    {"target": 3, "targetHandle": "x", "source": 4, "sourceHandle": null},
    {"target": 3, "targetHandle": "y", "source": 5, "sourceHandle": null}
  ]
}
```
As the workflow does not require any additional resources, the `environment.yml` file is not required. 

The corresponding Jupyter notebooks demonstrate this functionality:

### Quantum Espresso Workflow
The second workflow example is the calculation of an energy volume curve with Quantum Espresso. In the first step the 
initial structure is relaxed, afterwards it is strained and the total energy is calculated. 
* [quantum_espresso_workflow.py](quantum_espresso_workflow.py) Python functions 
* [workflow_qe.json](workflow_qe.json) Workflow definition in the Python Workflow Definition.
* [environment.yml](environment.yml) Conda environment
